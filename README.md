# Python Projects Overview
This repository showcases various Python projects I've worked on to strengthen my understanding of Python syntax, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and data structures. The projects range from building simple calculators to more advanced applications, such as a bank account management system. Below is an organized summary of these projects.

1. **Python Syntax**
   
1.1 **Pizza Order Program**
This project focuses on mastering Python's basic syntax, particularly user interaction through input/output functions.
**Features**:
- Asks customers for their pizza preferences (e.g., size, toppings).
- Calculates the total cost based on the selected options.
- Provides a summary of the order.
**Key Concepts:**
- Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
- Loops
- Handling user input with input()
  
2. **Python Functions**
   
2.1 **Simple Calculator**
This project involves building a basic calculator to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
**Features:**
- Takes two numbers as input.
- Performs the selected arithmetic operation.
- Displays the result.
**Key Concepts:**
- Function creation and usage (def)
- Arithmetic operators
- Return statements
  
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   
3.1 **Bank Account**
This project demonstrates how to use OOP principles to simulate bank account management.
**Features:**
- Create a bank account with an initial balance.
- Deposit and withdraw funds.
- Check account balance.
**Key Concepts:**
- Classes and objects
- Constructors (__init__)
- Encapsulation (private and public methods)
  
3.2 **Advanced Calculator**
An extension of the basic calculator using OOP principles, offering advanced functionalities.
**Features:**
- Handles multiple arithmetic operations.
- Modular design for easier expansion of functionalities.
- Supports advanced calculations like power and square root.
**Key Concepts:**
- Class-based design
- Inheritance
- Method overloading
  
4. **Python Data Structures**
   
4.1 **Shopping List Program**
This project utilizes Python's data structures, specifically lists, to create a shopping list manager.
**Features:**
- Add, remove, and view items in the shopping list.
- Displays the current shopping list.
- Option to clear the entire list.
**Key Concepts:**
- List operations (append(), remove(), clear())
- Looping through lists
- Managing user inputs
